Exploring Parcel the web application bundler. <br>
Parcel is a zero configuration web application bundler .

## adding parcel to the project

`npm install --save-dev parcel`

Parcel has a development server built in, which will automatically rebuild our app as we make changes. Servers runs on http://localhost:1234 port.

To start it, run the parcel CLI pointing to your entry file:<br/>
`npx parcel src/index.html`

## parcel build process \*\*

`npx parcel src/index.html`

When you type `npx parcel src/index.html` into our terminal, we are instructing the npx tool to execute the parcel command with the specified input file as the entry point. Parcel can take any file as an entry point.

Parcel is a web application bundler, and this command initiates its bundling process.

1. `Locate parcel Package`: is parcel package is available or not.
2. `Execute parcel with Entry Point`: Entrypoint serves as the starting point for our web application.
3. `Parcel Bundling Process`:
    - `Parsing & Dependency Resolution`: Parcel reads the specified HTML file & analyzes its dependencies, including JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets referenced within the HTML and its linked files.
    - `Bundling & Transformation`: Parcel bundles and transforms these dependencies into a format that is optimized for the web. It applies various optimizations such as **minification**, **tree shaking**, & **code splitting**.
    - `Output Generation`: Once the bundling & transformation process is complete, Parcel generates an output directory containing the bundled and optimized assets. This directory typically includes an index.html file and associated JavaScript and CSS files.
    - `dist Directory`: The output directory is typically named dist, and it's where Parcel places the final, optimized, and bundled files for your web application.
    - `.cache Directory`: The .cache directory (with a leading dot) is used by Parcel to store intermediate build artifacts and cached data to speed up the build process. This directory is also created in your project's root directory.
    - `Development Server` : http://localhost:1234
    - `Build Summary`: Parcel will provide a build summary in your terminal

## `Hot Module Replacement (HMR)`

HMR is a feature provided by Parcel. HMR allows us to update your application's code in real-time while the application is running, without requiring a full page reload.

Enabling HMR

1. Start Development Server: `npx parcel serve appEntryPoint`
2. Automatic HMR: Parcel automatically detects changes in our code(HTML,JS,CSS) & updates the application in the browser on the fly.
    - E.g, We're working on a React component and you save your changes, Parcel will update only the changed component in the browser without reloading the entire page.

## Package scripts

So far, weâ€™ve been running the parcel CLI directly `npx parcel serve appEntryPoint`, but it can be useful to create some scripts in your _package.json_ file to make this easier. <br>

**package.json**

```json
{
	"name": "my-project",
	"source": "src/index.html",
	"scripts": {
		"start": "parcel",
		"build": "parcel build"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"parcel": "^2.9.3"
	}
}
```

**package.json's _Breakdown_**

1. `Entrypoint`: "source": "src/index.html"

2. `npm run start` -> parcel entry point (development stage)

    - "start": "parcel" is used for local development, serving your application with HMR.

3. `npm run build` -> parcel build entry point (production stage)
    - "build": "parcel build" is used to generate a production build that you can deploy to a web server.
    - How we deploy - upload the contents of the dist directory generated by Parcel's build process.

## Multiple Entry points

single-page applications (SPAs) will have single entry points.
multi-Page Application (MPA) will have Multiple Entry Points.
